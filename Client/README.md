# DrawIt!

A fullstack Draw&Guess game project.

I created the game with:
- NodeJS
- Express
- Socket.IO
- React
- SCSS

**DrawIt! is fully responsive across all platforms! :)**

# How to play
To begin a game, simply enter a user name & room name and click the “play” button.

Due to the rules of the game, each room is accessible to a maximum of two people at a time.

The first player to enter the room will choose a word to draw and then draw it, while the second player to enter will receive the drawing and guess what was painted.

Upon guessing – the roles will be reversed and points will be added to the game session, when both players refresh/close the tab, the room will reset.

The player’s highest game score will be saved locally and presented on the main screen.

## Extra features
- Live online play session using socket.io
- The drawing will be sent along with the **video** of how the other player drew it, and it can be replayed.
- You can change colors while painting.
- Drawings can be saved in local storage and reloaded later.
